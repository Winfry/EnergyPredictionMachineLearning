Energy Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms 

Machine learning is a compilations of software applications that allows data to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.I used Machine Learning specifically Supervised Learning because it gave my project a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns.When it comes to advantages in this project , I used to find the most used power tariff and which regions will increase in the use of energy units with a future model.
